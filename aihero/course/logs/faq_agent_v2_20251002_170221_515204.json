The name should be in the format `dbt_<first initial><last name>` if you didn\u2019t change the default settings.\n\n2. **Check Region Consistency:**\n   - Ensure both datasets are in the same region. Typically, your source data is in your region, while the write location could be multi-regional (e.g., US).\n   - If there's a mismatch, delete the datasets and recreate them in the specified region with the correct naming format.\n\n3. **Specify Single-Region Location:**\n   - Instead of using a multi-regional location like `US`, specify the exact region (e.g., `US-east1`). Refer to [this Github comment](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-bigquery/issues/19#issuecomment-635545315) for more details.\n   - Additional guidance is available in [this post](https://learningdataengineering540969211.wordpress.com/dbt-cloud-and-bigquery-an-effort-to-try-and-resolve-location-issues/).\n\n4. **Update Location in DBT Cloud:**\n   - Go to your profile page (top right drop-down --> profile).\n   - Under Credentials --> Analytics (or your customized name), click on BigQuery >.\n   - Hit Edit and update your location. You may need to re-upload your service account JSON to refresh your private key.

Here are two solutions to address this issue:\n\n**Solution #1: Matching the dataset's data location with the source dataset**\n\n- Set your \u2018prod\u2019 dataset's data location to match the data location of your \u2018trips_data_all\u2019 dataset in BigQuery. The dbt process works for the instructor because her \u2018prod\u2019 dataset is in the same region as her source data. Since your \u2018trips_data_all\u2019 is in europe-west10 (or another region besides US), your prod needs to be there too, not US (which is the default setting when dbt creates a dataset for you in BigQuery).\n\n**Solution #2: Changing the dataset to <development dataset>**\n\n1. Go to: Deploy / Environments / Production (your production environment) / Settings.\n2. Look at the Deployment credentials. There is an input field called Dataset. The input of \u2018prod\u2019 is likely here.\n3. Replace \u2018prod\u2019 with the name of the Dataset that you worked with during development (before moving to Production). This is the Dataset name inside your BigQuery where you successfully ran \u2018dbt debug\u2019 and \u2018dbt build\u2019.\n4. After saving, you are ready to rerun your Job!",

Prepare your source data** | \u2022 Create a BigQuery project and dataset (e.g., `dev_dataset`).  <br>\u2022 Load the raw tables (or create a copy of a public dataset).  <br>\u2022 Verify the dataset **location** (region) \u2013 it must match the location you\u2019ll set in dbt Cloud. | *No cross\u2011region mismatch* | [Setup: No development environment](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/faq/blob/main/faq-main/_questions/data-engineering-zoomcamp/module-4/006_29469cf158_setup-no-development-environment.md) |\n| **2. Create a GitHub repository** | \u2022 Push your dbt project files to GitHub (including `dbt_project.yml`, `profiles.yml`, models, tests). | *Repo must be public or have the correct permission for dbt\u2011Cloud* | \u2013 |\n| **3. Add a BigQuery service account** | \u2022 In GCP \u2192 IAM & Admin \u2192 Service Accounts, create a service account.  <br>\u2022 Assign the roles: <br>\u2003\u2022 BigQuery Job User  <br>\u2003\u2022 BigQuery Data Owner <br>\u2003\u2022 BigQuery Data Editor <br>\u2003\u2022 Storage Object Admin <br>\u2003\u2022 Storage Admin | *The JSON key file is required for dbt\u2011Cloud* | [Setup: Connecting dbt Cloud with BigQuery Error](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/faq/blob/main/faq-main/_questions/data-engineering-zoomcamp/module-4/007_b4a5d32d6b_setup-connecting-dbt-cloud-with-bigquery-error.md) |\n| **4. Create a **Development Environment** in dbt\u2011Cloud** | \u2022 In dbt\u2011Cloud \u2192 **Settings** \u2192 **Environments** \u2192 **Create**.  <br>\u2022 Choose the repo you just pushed and the branch (usually `dev` or `main`).  <br>\u2022 For the **Credentials** field, upload the service\u2011account JSON you created.  <br>\u2022 Set the **Dataset** name (e.g., `dev_dataset`) and **Location** that matches your BigQuery dataset. | \u2022 `dbt debug` should return *All good!*. <br>\u2022 The *Develop* tab will now show your models. | [Setup: I\u2019ve set Github and Bigquery to dbt successfully. Why nothing showed in my Develop tab?](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/faq/blob/main/faq-main/_questions/data-engineering-zoomcamp/module-4/061_dfd4ddbf39_setup-ive-set-github-and-bigquery-to-dbt-successfu.md) |\n| **5. Verify the development environment** | \u2022 Run `dbt debug` in the dbt\u2011Cloud terminal or via the UI to confirm the connection. <br>\u2022 Build a model (`dbt build` or `dbt run` in the UI) to make sure tables materialize. | *No permission or location errors* | \u2013 |\n| **6. Create a **Deployment Environment** (e.g., Production)** | \u2022 Duplicate the dev environment or create a new one.  <br>\u2022 Use a **Production**\u2011type environment. <br>\u2022 Supply a **different** service account if you want stricter permissions (often the same account but you can change the dataset name). <br>\u2022 Set the **Dataset** to the production dataset (e.g., `prod_dataset`). <br>\u2022 Ensure the **Location** matches the production BigQuery dataset. | \u2022 `dbt debug` must succeed in the prod environment too. | \u2013 |\n| **7. Configure a job** | \u2022 In dbt\u2011Cloud \u2192 **Jobs** \u2192 **Create**. <br>\u2022 Select the **Deployment Environment** you just created. <br>\u2022 Choose the target schema (usually your prod dataset). <br>\u2022 Set the *Model* scope (all models, a subset, or specific models). | \u2022 The job can be scheduled or run on\u2011demand. <br>\u2022 Confirm the job runs without errors. | \u2013 |\n| **8. Optional \u2013 Branching strategy** | \u2022 Keep a separate **dev** branch for iterative changes and merge to **main** (or **prod**) when ready. <br>\u2022 In the deployment environment, set the branch to `main`. | *Pull requests must be merged before the prod job can run* | \u2013 |\n\n### Quick\u2011reference checklist\n\n- [ ] BigQuery project & dataset created (region = region)\n- [ ] GitHub repo ready, dbt files committed\n- [ ] Service\u2011account JSON uploaded to dbt\u2011Cloud (roles: Job User, Data Owner, etc.)\n- [ ] Development environment created \u2192 `dbt debug` passes \u2192 models build\n- [ ] Deployment (prod) environment created \u2192 `dbt debug` passes \u2192 tables materialize\n- [ ] Job created in dbt\u2011Cloud \u2192 points to prod env \u2192 scheduled/running\n\nIf you run into a \u201cDataset not found in location\u201d or \u201cAccess denied\u201d error, double\u2011check the dataset name, the region in BigQuery, and that the service account has the *BigQuery Job User* role (see the FAQ on location mismatches).\n\nHappy modeling!",
