Open **Git\u2011Bash** (or any Bash\u2011like terminal that supports `winpty`).\n2. Run `pgcli` through `winpty`:\n\n   ```bash\n   winpty pgcli -h localhost -p 5432 -u root -d ny_taxi\n   ```\n\n   - `-h localhost` \u2013 host\n   - `-p 5432` \u2013 port\n   - `-u root` \u2013 username\n   - `-d ny_taxi` \u2013 database\n\n3. You\u2019ll now see the password prompt and can type your password without the\n   program hanging.\n\nAlternatively, you can use Windows Terminal or VS\u202fCode\u2019s integrated terminal; just\nprefix the command with `winpty` if you still encounter the hang.\n\n> **Reference**: [PGCLI - stuck on password prompt](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/faq/blob/main/_questions/data-engineering-zoomcamp/module-1/064_6704978d67_pgcli-stuck-on-password-prompt.md)",
