Here are a couple of suggestions for managing storage:\n\n- **Clean up your GCP VM drive:** Use the command below to identify what is taking up the most space:\n\n  ```bash\n  sudo du -sh *\n  ```\n\n  - **(~1GB)** For me, the Anaconda installer was consuming a lot of space. If you no longer need it, you can delete it:\n  \n    ```bash\n    rm -rf <anacondainstaller_fpath>\n    ```\n\n  - **(~3GB)** Anaconda itself takes up a lot of space. You can\u2019t delete it entirely if you need Python, but you can clean it up significantly:\n    \n    ```bash\n    conda clean --all -y\n    ```\n\n- **Clean up your Kestra files:** Use a purge flow. You can find a generic example here:\n  \n  [https://kestra.io/docs/administrator-guide/purge](https://kestra.io/docs/administrator-guide/purge)\n  \n  I wanted to perform the cleanup immediately, rather than waiting until the end of the month, so I adjusted the `endDate` to `\"{{ now() }}\"` and removed the trigger block. You can also choose whether to remove FAILED state executions.\n\n- **Clean up your PostgreSQL database:** You can manually delete tables in pgAdmin, or set up a workflow in Kestra for it. I found it easy to do manually.",

In Kestra, create a \u201cpurge\u201d flow (see <https://kestra.io/docs/administrator-guide/purge>). <br>2. Adjust the `endDate` to `\"{{ now() }}\"` to purge everything up to the current moment. <br>3. Optionally set `removeFailedExecutions: true` if you don\u2019t need FAILED state logs. | Keeps Kestra\u2019s local storage lean. |\n| **Kestra storage directory** | Manually remove old data (only if you\u2019re sure you won\u2019t need it) | `rm -rf /app/storage/*` | Use the path you configured in the Kestra Docker/compose setup. |\n| **PostgreSQL database** | Delete unnecessary tables or rows | 1. Use `pgAdmin` or `psql` to drop tables: `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS my_old_table;` <br>2. Or run a custom SQL purge: `DELETE FROM executions WHERE end_date < NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';` | Be careful \u2013 backup before dropping. |\n| **PostgreSQL logs & temp files** | Remove old log files | `find /var/log/postgresql/ -type f -name '*.log' -mtime +30 -delete` | Keeps only the last 30 days of logs. |\n| **Other temp directories** | Clean system temp | `sudo rm -rf /tmp/*` | Use with caution; only remove if not in use. |\n| **Package caches** | Remove unused package caches | `sudo apt-get clean` (if apt is used) | Frees cache used by system updates. |\n\n### Quick\u2011start script\n\n```bash\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\nset -euo pipefail\n\necho \"=== Identifying largest directories ===\"\nsudo du -sh / | sort -hr | head -20\n\necho \"=== Removing Anaconda installer if present ===\"\nrm -f /path/to/Anaconda*.sh\n\necho \"=== Cleaning Anaconda caches ===\"\nconda clean --all -y\n\necho \"=== Purging Kestra executions via API (example) ===\"\ncurl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n     -d '{\"name\":\"purge_flow\"}' \\\n     http://localhost:8080/api/v1/flows/run\n\necho \"=== Deleting old Kestra storage files ===\"\nrm -rf /app/storage/*\n\necho \"=== Cleaning old PostgreSQL logs ===\"\nfind /var/log/postgresql/ -type f -name '*.log' -mtime +30 -delete\n\necho \"=== Cleaning system apt cache ===\"\nsudo apt-get clean\n\necho \"=== Finished! ===\"\n```\n\n> **Tip:** Run the script in a `screen` or `tmux` session so you can reconnect if the SSH session drops.\n\n---\n\n#### Source\n\nThis answer is based on the guidance provided in the FAQ entry *\u201cRunning out of storage while trying to backfill\u201d* found at:\n\n- [Running out of storage while trying to backfill](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/faq/blob/main/_questions/data-engineering-zoomcamp/module-2/007_00e8093b90_running-out-of-storage-when-using-kestra-with-post.md)\n\nFeel free to adjust paths and dates to match your environment.
