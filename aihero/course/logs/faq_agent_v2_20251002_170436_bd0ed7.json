Familiarize yourself with documentation as a crucial skill for problem-solving.\n- Use shortcuts like `[ctrl+f]` to search within documents and browsers.\n- Analyze the error message for descriptions, instructions, and possible solutions.\n- Restart your application, server, or computer as needed.\n  \n**Search for Solutions:**\n\n- Use search engines like Google, ChatGPT, or Bing AI to research the issue. It is rare to encounter a unique problem.\n- Form your search queries using: `<technology> <problem statement>`. E.g., `pgcli error column c.relhasoids does not exist.`\n- Consult the technology\u2019s official documentation for guidance.\n\n**Uninstallation and Reinstallation:**\n\n- Uninstall and then reinstall the application if needed, including a system restart.\n- Note that reinstalling without prior uninstallation might not resolve the issue.\n\n**Seeking Help:**\n\n- Post questions on platforms like StackOverflow. Ensure your question adheres to guidelines: [how-to-ask](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask).\n- Consider asking experts or colleagues in the future.\n\n**Community Resources:**\n\n- Check Slack channels for pinned messages and use its search function.\n- Refer to this FAQ using search `[ctrl+f]` or utilize the `@ZoomcampQABot` for assistance.\n\n**When Asking for Help:**\n\n- Provide detailed information: coding environment, OS, commands, videos followed, etc.\n- Share errors received, with specifics, including line numbers and actions taken.\n- Avoid screenshots; paste code or errors directly. Use ``` for code formatting.\n- Maintain thread consistency; respond in the same thread instead of creating multiple ones.\n\n**Re-evaluation:**\n\n- If the issue recurs, create a new post detailing changes in the environment.\n- Communicate additional troubleshooting steps in the same thread.\n- Occasionally take a break to gain a fresh perspective on the problem.\n\n**Documentation Contribution:**\n\n- If your problem solution is not listed, consider adding it to the FAQ to assist others.",

You\u2019ll use this ID (or the network name) in other commands. |\n| **NAME** | Human\u2011readable name. Built\u2011in networks include `bridge`, `host`, and `none`. User\u2011created networks (like `my\u2011custom`) appear here. |\n| **DRIVER** | The network driver that implements the network. Common drivers: `bridge` (default for containers on the same host), `overlay` (for multi\u2011host Swarm clusters), `macvlan`, etc. |\n| **SCOPE** | Whether the network is local to the host (`local`) or spans a swarm (`swarm`). For most non\u2011Swarm setups this will be `local`. |\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd0e Inspect a specific network\n\nIf you want to see the detailed configuration\u2014subnet, gateway, connected containers, options, etc.\u2014run:\n\n```bash\ndocker network inspect <network-name-or-id>\n```\n\nExample:\n\n```bash\ndocker network inspect my-custom\n```\n\nThis returns JSON with fields such as:\n\n- `Subnet`, `Gateway`\n- `IPAM` configuration\n- `Containers` (listing each container\u2019s ID, IP address, aliases)\n- `Options`, `Labels`\n\n---\n\n### Quick sanity check\n\nIf you\u2019re troubleshooting why a container can\u2019t reach another, verify:\n\n1. **Both containers are on the same network** (`docker network inspect <net>` shows both IDs under `Containers`).\n2. **Network driver** supports the needed features (e.g., `overlay` is required for cross\u2011host communication in a Swarm).\n3. **No conflicting IP ranges** (subnets that overlap can cause routing problems).\n\n---\n\n#### If you want a deeper dive or run into specific errors\n\n- Use `docker network ls -q` to get just IDs, then `docker network inspect <id>` for more details.\n- Check Docker\u2019s official docs on [Networking](https://docs.docker.com/network/) for advanced configuration.\n\n---\n\n**No repository reference was found for this exact question, so the answer above is based on standard Docker usage.**",
