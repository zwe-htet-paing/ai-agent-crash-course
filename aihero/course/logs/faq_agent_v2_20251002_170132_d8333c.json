The most common ones you\u2019ll see are:\n\n| Tool | Typical version | What you can do |\n|------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| **Docker** | Latest stable (e.g., 20.x) | Run containers, build images, manage services. |\n| **Docker Compose** | Latest stable | Compose multi\u2011container Docker apps. |\n| **Python** | 3.10+ (plus `pip` & `venv`) | Run scripts, install packages, create virtual environments. |\n| **Node.js** | 18+ | Run JavaScript/TypeScript tooling, npm/yarn. |\n| **Git** | 2.x | Clone, fetch, push, etc. |\n| **VS\u202fCode extensions** | Pre\u2011installed set | Python, Docker, GitLens, Jupyter, etc. |\n| **Jupyter Notebook & JupyterLab** | 3.x | Interactive notebooks. |\n| **tmux, htop, curl, wget** | Standard Linux tools | Terminal multiplexing, system monitoring, HTTP utilities. |\n| **bash / zsh** | Standard | Shell scripting. |\n| **PostgreSQL client (`psql`)** | Included via Docker | Connect to Postgres containers or remote DBs. |\n| **R, RStudio Server** | Optional (via extensions) | For R\u2011based workflows. |\n\n> **Source**  \n> \u201cEnvironment \u2013 Is GitHub codespaces an alternative to using cli/git bash to ingest the data and create a docker file?\u201d \u2013 *faq-main/_questions/data\u2011engineering\u2011zoomcamp/general/023_5b4fb0c0a8_environment-is-github-codespaces-an-alternative-to.md*  \n> [Environment](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/faq/blob/main/faq-main/_questions/data-engineering-zoomcamp/general/023_5b4fb0c0a8_environment-is-github-codespaces-an-alternative-to.md)\n\nThese tools are ready to use out of the box, so you can jump straight into building your ETL pipelines, spinning up Docker\u2011based services, or prototyping Python scripts without any additional setup.
