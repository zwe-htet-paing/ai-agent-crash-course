Terraform\u2019s CLI does **not** automatically pick up the system\u2011wide proxy settings, so you have to configure it explicitly in the terminal session.\n\n**Quick fix (from the FAQ)**  \nOpen your VPN in \u201cEnhanced Mode\u201d (for example, **Clash**), then re\u2011run the command:\n\n```bash\nterraform apply\n```\n\nThe VPN\u2019s enhanced mode forwards DNS and HTTP(S) traffic correctly, letting Terraform reach `storage.googleapis.com` and the provider registry.\n\n> *Source:* [Terraform: Error: Post \u201cstorage.googleapis.com\u201d\u2026](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/faq/blob/main/_questions/data-engineering-zoomcamp/module-1/115_31053272e0_terraform-error-post-storagegoogleapiscomhttpsstor.md)\n\n---\n\n### If you\u2019re on a system proxy instead of a VPN\n\nTerraform respects the following environment variables, which you can set in your shell profile (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.):\n\n| Variable | Purpose |\n|----------|---------|\n| `HTTP_PROXY` | For plain HTTP |\n| `HTTPS_PROXY` | For HTTPS |\n| `NO_PROXY` | Comma\u2011separated list of hosts that bypass the proxy |\n\nExample for a corporate proxy:\n\n```bash\nexport HTTP_PROXY=\"http://proxy.company.com:8080\"\nexport HTTPS_PROXY=\"http://proxy.company.com:8080\"\nexport NO_PROXY=\"localhost,127.0.0.1,.company.com\"\n```\n\nAfter adding these, reload your shell (`source ~/.bashrc`) and try `terraform init` / `apply` again.\n\n---\n\n### Common pitfalls\n\n| Problem | Fix |\n|---------|-----|\n| **Terraform still can\u2019t reach the registry** | Verify that the proxy actually allows outbound traffic to `*.googleapis.com` and `registry.terraform.io`. |\n| **You\u2019re behind a restrictive firewall** | Ask your IT team to whitelist those domains or provide a dedicated VPN profile that routes only the required traffic. |\n| **Proxy requires authentication** | Use `HTTP_PROXY=\"http://user:pass@proxy.company.com:8080\"` (be careful with credentials in shell history). |\n\n---\n\n### When all else fails\n\n1. **Check network connectivity**  \n   ```bash\n   curl -I https://registry.terraform.io\n   ```\n2. **Run Terraform with verbose logging**  \n   ```bash\n   TF_LOG=debug terraform init\n   ```\n   Inspect the logs for DNS or connection errors.\n\nIf you still hit the same timeout, it\u2019s likely a deeper network restriction. In that case, consult your network or VPN vendor for a configuration that allows Terraform\u2019s traffic to flow (e.g., enabling \u201csplit\u2011tunneling\u201d or a dedicated VPN profile).\n\nGood luck, and let me know if you hit any specific error messages!",
